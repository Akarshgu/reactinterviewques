<li>what is react and it uses?</li>

    React was created by jordane walke , a software engineer at facebook in the year 2011 and 
    it was deployed at yhe facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram
    React is  a open source front end js library created by facebook in 2011.
    it follows the component based approach for building reusable UI component for SPA and 
    i is used for developing interactive view layer of weband mobile application

<ul>
        <li>features of react</li>
        <li>virtual dom</li>
        <li>onw way data building</li>
        <li>reusable component</li>
        <li>jsx</li>
        <li>performance</li>

</ul>
<li>what is virtual DOM</li>
<ul>
    <li>
        Virtual DOM : DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM,
         which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen 
         for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. 
         Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state 
         variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , 
         instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, 
         one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom
         . Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values.
          Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes.
           this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real
            dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.

<li>Why you have opted for React not Angular or Vue</li>
<ul>
    <li>
        library or framework
    </li><li>
library is a set of reusable function used by computer programm and 
frame work is a piece of code that dictate the architecture of  aproject

<li>code calls the library but in frame work the framework calls the code.</li>

</li>
<li>
    in library we can control the data flow by methods but in framework we dont have any controlof the data flow frame work decides the data will; flow that is nothing but framewoks calls the code
</li>
<li>
    in performance wise react is having higher performance over anguler and veu and community support and
     also react is having the easy learning curve 
    and react i shaving SPA
</li></ul>
<li>class comp. v/s function comp. </li>
<ul><li>
class comp. we having react lifecycle methods 
where as in functional comp. have a hooks 
</li>
<li>
function comp. are also known as dstateless comp.
while in class comp. is called stateful comp. 
</li>
<li>
    and
    there is no render function while 
    in functional comp. there is return
</li>
<li>
    func. comp.  accet p[rops as arguments but props and state can be accepted in class comp.]
</li>
<li> in functional. it is easy to read as they have less code but in class comp. they have complex code structure and hard to write</li>
</ul>
<li>Differentiate between stateful and stateless components.</li>
<ul><li>
stateless comp. does not hold or manage state while statefull comp. can hold or manage state

</li>
<li>
    stateless comp. are easy to understand but in statefull comp. it is complex as compared to the stateless comp. 
</li>
<li>
    stateless comp. does not work with react lifecycles but whereas statefull work with lifecycle methods
</li>
<li>
    stateless can't be reused while in statefull comp. it can be used 
</li>
<li>stateless comp. is also known as funcional comp.and statefull is a class comp.</li></ul>



<li>
    What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?
</li>
<ul><li>
    1.	Initial Phase
    2.	Mounting Phase
    3.	Updating Phase
    4.	Unmounting Phase
</li></ul>
<li>
    what is SPA? explain the difference between SPA & MPA?
</li>
<ul><li>
In terms of speed and performance SPA no reloading is needed i.e. = to high speed & responsive

</li>
<li>
    In MPA which is having slow speed & performance is effective by reloading
</li>
<li>
    Acc. to  Cooding Wise resuable  code For SPA
</li>
<li>
    in MPA to coding start from scratch.
</li>
<li>
    acc. to maintenance SPA is fast And easy maintaenanace but for MPA maintainance required for each page
</li>
<li>
    acc. to SEO SPA is having limited optimization.

</li>
<li>
    Acc. to user experience SPA is very smooth and friendly. but in MPA it is very BAd

</li>
<li>
    Thre is no loading time required for SPA.
</li>
<li>SPA secures only endpoints but in MPA secures end to end.</li>
</ul>

<li>Diff. between state and props.</li>
<ul><li>
State changes can be asynchronous but in props can be readonly
</li>
<li>
    Props can be accesed by child component but state cant be accesed .
</li>
<li>* Props are used to communication between components</li>
<li>
    State can be used to change render dynamic changes within the comp.
</li>
<li>Props are immutable and are external and control by whereever render the comp.</li>
<li>State is mutable and State is internal and control by react comp. it self</li>


</ul>
<li>
    Explain props drilling concept and state uplifting
</li>
<ul><li>
props drilling is a basically a situation in the same data is been sent
almost every due to the requirement in the final level
</li>
<li>
    when we have to share the same data across multiple child components then define the data into the paraent
</li>
<li>
    every comp. in react has its own state because of this somtimes data can be  reabundant 
    and inconsistent so by lifting the state of the parent comp. 
    as a single sourse of the truth and pass data of the children in its parent
</li>

</ul>

<li>What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?</li>

<ul><li>
in the react component dat is controll by the react component or parentcomponent 
</li>
<li>
    In the Uncontrolled comp. data is controled by dom itself
</li>
<li>controll comp. allows validation control where as uncontroled comp. doesnt allow validation control </li>

<li>In control comp. it has better control over the props and data </li>
<li>
    In uncontrol comp. limited control over the forms and data 
</li>
</ul>
<li>What is React Router?</li>
<ul><li>
    React router is a standard library for outing in recat it enables 
    navigation among the views of various component in react applicationit allow changing the browser URL.
</li>
<li>
It  palys an imp. role to dispalymultiple vies in a SPA
</li>
</ul>
